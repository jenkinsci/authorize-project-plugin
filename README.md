This plugin allows configuring projects to run with specified authorization.

## What's this?

This plugin provides following features:

-   You can configure projects to have their builds run with specified
    authorization.
    -   This is an implementation for
        [QueueItemAuthenticator](http://javadoc.jenkins-ci.org/jenkins/security/QueueItemAuthenticator.html).
-   Provides following ways to specify authorization.
    -   Run as the user who triggered the build.
        -   Does not work for scheduled, or polled builds.
        -   Configuring projects are allowed only to users with the
            BUILD permission.
    -   Run as anonymous.
    -   Run as the specified user.
        -   You are requested to enter the password of the specified
            user except following cases:
            -   You are an administrator.
            -   You are the specified user.
            -   The specified user is not changed from the last
                configuration, and "No need for re-authentication" is
                checked.
                -   This can threaten your Jenkins security. Be careful
                    to use.
        -   Configuring projects are allowed only to administrators and
            the user configured as the authorization.
            -   "Don't restrict job configuration" allows other users
                (with the CONFIGURE permission) to configure the
                project. Ensure that only appropriate users have
                CONFIGURE permission for that project.
    -   Run as SYSTEM
        -   This is provided only to cancel the global configuration.
            SYSTEM authorization is often considered as "unconfigured",
            features provided by plugins may treat it as anonymous.
-   Provides an extension point to add new ways to specify
    authorization.

## Screenshots

-   After installed Authorize Project plugin, you will find "Access
    Control for Builds" in "Manage Jenkins" \> "Configure Global
    Security". Adding "Configure Build Authorizations in Project
    Configuration" enables Authorize Project plugin.  
    ![](docs/images/authorize-project_01_globalsecurity.png)
    -   You can also disable specific strategies in this page. Disabled
        strategies are never used for authorization.
-   A new side bar menu "Authorization" will appear in project pages.  
    ![](docs/images/sidebar.png)
-   You can select how to authorize builds of the project in the
    "Authorization" page.  
    ![](docs/images/authorization-page.png)
-   When selecting "Run as Specific User", you can enter User ID with
    whose authorization builds will run. If you enter a user ID except
    yourself and have no administrative privilege, you are required to
    enter the password of that user.  
    ![](docs/images/authorization-page-specific-user.png)
    -   You can also use API token, especially for non password-based
        security realms.
-   Configuring project settings by unauthorized users are forbidden
    when you configure the authorization for the project. See [\#What's
    this?](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Authorize+Project+plugin#AuthorizeProjectplugin-What%27sthis?)
    for details.

## Extension point

A new way to authorize projects can be added with extending
`org.jenkinsci.plugins.authorizeproject.AuthorizeProjectStrategy`,
overriding the following method:

``` syntaxhighlighter-pre
public abstract Authentication authenticate(hudson.model.AbstractProject<?, ?> project, hudson.model.Queue.Item item);
```

Use `AuthorizeProjectStrategyDescriptor` for `Descriptor`.  
If you want to provide global configuration properties, do as following:

-   `global-security.jelly` is displayed in "Configure Global Security"
    page.
-   Override
    `AuthorizeProjectStrategyDescriptor#configureFromGlobalSecurity` to
    save configuration.
