https://jenkins.io[Jenkins] plugin to configure a project to run with specified authorization.

== What's this?

This plugin provides following features:

* Projects can be configured to have their builds run with specified authorization.
 ** This is an implementation for https://javadoc.jenkins-ci.org/jenkins/security/QueueItemAuthenticator.html[`QueueItemAuthenticator`].
* The following ways are provided to specify authorization.
 ** Run as the user who triggered the build.
  *** Does not work for scheduled, or polled builds.
 ** Run as anonymous.
 ** Run as the specified user.
  *** You are requested to enter the password of the specified user except for the following cases:
   **** You are an administrator.
   **** You are the specified user.
   **** The specified user is not changed from the last configuration, and "No need for re-authentication" is checked.
    ***** This can threaten your Jenkins security. Be careful to use.
* Provides an extension point to add new ways to specify authorization.

== Extension point

A new way to authorize projects can be added by extending `org.jenkinsci.plugins.authorizeproject.AuthorizeProjectStrategy`, overriding the following method:

----
public abstract Authentication authenticate(hudson.model.AbstractProject<?, ?> project, hudson.model.Queue.Item item);
----

== Screenshots

* After installed Authorize Project plugin, you will find "Access
Control for Builds" in "Manage Jenkins" > "Configure Global
Security". Adding "Configure Build Authorizations in Project
Configuration" enables Authorize Project plugin. +

 ** You can also disable specific strategies in this page. Disabled
strategies are never used for authorization.
* A new side bar menu "Authorization" will appear in project pages. +

* You can select how to authorize builds of the project in the
"Authorization" page. +

* When selecting "Run as Specific User", you can enter User ID with
whose authorization builds will run. If you enter a user ID except
yourself and have no administrative privilege, you are required to
enter the password of that user. +

 ** You can also use API token, especially for non password-based
security realms.
* Configuring project settings by unauthorized users are forbidden
when you configure the authorization for the project. See https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Authorize+Project+plugin#AuthorizeProjectplugin-What%27sthis?[#What's
this?]
for details. +
