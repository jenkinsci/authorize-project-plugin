https://jenkins.io[Jenkins] plugin to configure a project to run with specified authorization.

== What's this?

This plugin provides following features:

* Projects can be configured to have their builds run with specified authorization.
 ** This is an implementation for https://javadoc.jenkins-ci.org/jenkins/security/QueueItemAuthenticator.html[`QueueItemAuthenticator`].
* The following ways are provided to specify authorization.
 ** Run as the user who triggered the build.
  *** Does not work for scheduled, or polled builds.
 ** Run as anonymous.
 ** Run as the specified user.
  *** You are requested to enter the password of the specified user except for the following cases:
   **** You are an administrator.
   **** You are the specified user.
   **** The specified user is not changed from the last configuration, and "No need for re-authentication" is checked.
    ***** This can threaten your Jenkins security. Be careful to use.
* Provides an extension point to add new ways to specify authorization.

== Extension point

A new way to authorize projects can be added by extending `org.jenkinsci.plugins.authorizeproject.AuthorizeProjectStrategy`, overriding the following method:

----
public abstract Authentication authenticate(hudson.model.AbstractProject<?, ?> project, hudson.model.Queue.Item item);
----
